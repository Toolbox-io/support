  two attempts (can be configured), you can configure the following actions:
    - Beep at 100% volume (you can adjust the melody).
    - Photos from the front camera.

  > The device administrator's permission is required for this feature to work in order to detect unlock attempts.

  when someone picks up your phone).

  It's very easy to use: You click a button in the section, and after that any
  touching your phone will be recorded. When you want to turn this off
  protection, just click "Stop" and the protection will turn off.
